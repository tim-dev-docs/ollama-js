# High Level Context
## context
This file, src/index.ts, is the main entry point for an Ollama client library. It extends a browser-based Ollama class with additional functionality for working with local files and streaming data. Key features include:

1. Image encoding for handling various input types (Uint8Array, Buffer, filepath, or base64 string)
2. Modelfile parsing and processing, including replacing FROM and ADAPTER commands with blob hashes
3. File system operations for working with local files and paths
4. Blob creation and management for file uploads
5. Model creation functionality that can handle both local files and provided modelfile content
6. Support for both streaming and non-streaming responses

The file also exports all types from the interfaces file, making it easier for consumers of the library to access type definitions. Overall, this code appears to be part of a TypeScript-based SDK for interacting with an Ollama API, providing both browser and Node.js compatible functionality.

# Ollama src/index.ts
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, Ollama is a class that extends OllamaBrowser. It provides additional functionality and methods for working with the Ollama system, which is likely a language model or AI-related tool. Here's a concise explanation of what Ollama does in this code:

1. It handles image encoding, converting images to base64 format.
2. It parses and modifies modelfiles, replacing certain commands with blob hashes.
3. It manages file paths, resolving them to absolute paths.
4. It checks for file existence.
5. It creates blobs from files, computing SHA256 digests and uploading them if necessary.
6. It overrides the 'create' method from the parent class, adding functionality to handle modelfile processing before calling the parent method.

Overall, this class seems to be responsible for preparing and managing data and models for the Ollama system, handling file operations, and interfacing with an API for model creation and blob management.
