# High Level Context
## context
This file defines the main Ollama class, which extends OllamaBrowser and provides additional functionality for working with the Ollama API in a Node.js environment. Key features include:

1. Image encoding for handling different input types (Uint8Array, Buffer, filepath, or base64 string).
2. Modelfile parsing and processing, including replacing FROM and ADAPTER commands with blob hashes.
3. File system operations for checking file existence and creating blobs.
4. Implementation of the 'create' method for creating models, supporting both streaming and non-streaming responses.
5. Utility functions for path resolution and SHA256 hash generation.

The file also exports all types from the interfaces file, making it the main entry point for the Ollama package. It creates and exports a default instance of the Ollama class for easy use in other parts of the application.

# encodeImage src/index.ts
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function:

The `encodeImage` function is an asynchronous method that takes an image input (either as a Uint8Array, Buffer, or string) and returns a Promise that resolves to a base64-encoded string representation of the image. It handles three scenarios:

1. If the input is a Uint8Array or Buffer, it converts it directly to a base64 string.
2. If the input is a string and represents a valid file path, it reads the file and converts its contents to a base64 string.
3. If the input is a string but not a file path, it assumes the string might already be base64-encoded and returns it as-is.

This function is useful for preparing image data for APIs or services that require base64-encoded image inputs.
